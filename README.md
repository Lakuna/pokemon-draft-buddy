# Pokémon Draft Buddy

This is a simple script that uses [Puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/) to scrape [Smogon](https://www.smogon.com/) for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet draft information. Can easily be modified to scrape any other information available in the [Smogon Strategy Pokédex](https://www.smogon.com/dex/).

Smogon does not have a public API, so this script could break at any time.
